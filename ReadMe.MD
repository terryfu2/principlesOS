## Palindrome

Read through a file and find the longest palindrome. Needs to be as efficent as possible, as file sizes reach 2Gb+ and needs to finish under 30secs.

## analyzeDir

Get the largest file path, largest file size, number of files, number of dirs, common file types, common words and total files size given a parent directory. Needs to be efficent, as file and sub directories reach 10000+ total.
